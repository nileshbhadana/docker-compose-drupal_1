# docker-compose-drupal
This contains a docker-compose file to launch drupal in a container with database as postgres.
Start the containers by typing this:
	
	> bash install.sh
	> docker-compose up

This releases two containers, one of Drupal running on port 8080 and another of postgres. This also creates a docker network. Also the data of postgres is persistantly stored through docker volumes. The data of drupal is stored through bind mounts in files folder in drupal directory


To stop these things, type:
	
	> docker-compose down
	
To remove the volumes as well, use:
	
	> docker-compose down -v

#Drupal

It's used by millions of people and organizations around the globe to build and maintain their websites. You probably use Drupal every day without knowing it, as many top businesses and government organizations use Drupal, like the Government of Australia, Red Cross, Harvard, The Economist, BBC, NBC News, Whole Foods, Cisco, Twitter, and many, many more.

#Postgres
PostgreSQL is a general purpose and object-relational database management system, the most advanced open source database system. PostgreSQL was developed based on POSTGRES 4.2 at Berkeley Computer Science Department, University of California.
PostgreSQL was designed to run on UNIX-like platforms. However, PostgreSQL was then also designed to be portable so that it could run on various platforms such as Mac OS X, Solaris, and Windows.
PostgreSQL is free and open source software. Its source code is available under PostgreSQL license, a liberal open source license. You are free to use, modify and distribute PostgreSQL in any form.
